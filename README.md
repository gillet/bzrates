# bzrates
bz-rates is a web-tool that takes into consideration the differential growth rate, b, and the plating efficiency, z, 
to calculate mutation rates from fluctuation assays. bz-rates implements two estimators: the Ma-Sandri-Sarkar maximum 
likelihood method and the generating function estimator. If you find bz-rates useful please site our paper: "bz-rates:
a web-tool to accurately estimate mutation rates from fluctuation assays.
This application was developed using Django v1.6 and Python2.7

#Add an estimator to bz-rates
You can add an estimator by modifying the view.py file and the contact.html file.

##view.py file
The ```bzrates/myform/view.py``` file contains the python functions of the estimators. You can add your own functions in it. 
Your custom estimator (functions) must be run in the "contact(request)" function (after the following commentary: 
```#After this  you can run you own estimator```. Note that if you do so, the bz-rates will only output the 
results of your own estimator. You might want to modify the if/else above or even add a choice bar).
The results of your estimator must be saved in a list which name must be ```res```. The first element of the list must
be a string with the name of your estimator (e.g. 'myEstimator')

##contact.html file
The ```/bzrates/myform/templates/contact.html``` file is THE html file of the web site. Find the line 126 (```<!-- HERE ADD 
YOUR ESTIMATOR OUTPUT, like above-->```) and replace it by something like:
  ``` 
  {% elif res.0 == "myEstimator" %}
  <form name="Form1">
  <textarea readonly class="txtArea">{{ res.0 }}
  m	{{ res.1 }}
  Î¼	{{ res.2 }}
  </textarea>
  </form>
  {% endif %}
  ```

#Configure apache to run bzrates
Please refer to the Django deployment Documentation for details (```https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/howto/deployment/wsgi/modwsgi/```). 
Briefly, the estimators are written with the Python language. A common software used to make the dialogue between html and 
Python possible is called mod_wsgi. Here is an example of an Apache2.2 config for bz-rates:
	```

	WSGIScriptAlias /bzrates /path/to/bzrates/mysite/wsgi.py
	WSGIPythonPath /path/to/bzrates
	WSGIApplicationGroup %{GLOBAL}

	<Directory /path/to/bzrates/mysite>
	    <Files wsgi.py>
		Order deny,allow
		Allow from all
	    </Files>
	</Directory>

	<Directory /path/to/bzrates/myform>
	    Order deny,allow
	    Allow from all
	</Directory>

	Alias /static /path/to/bzrates/static/
	<Directory /path/to/bzrates/static>
	    Order deny,allow
	    Allow from all
	</Directory>

	<Directory /path/to/bzrates/templates>
	    Order deny,allow
	    Allow from all
	</Directory>

	```
